       Added memcached format and upload each endpoint obtained.
v0.0.3 Added support for python3
v0.0.4 Changed from single configration file to all *.conf files in given directory.
v0.0.5 Added module import checks.
v0.0.6 StorageStats object class chosen dynamically based on configured plugin.
v0.0.7 Added options
v0.1.0 Changed aws-list to generic and now uses boto3 for generality.
v0.2.0 Added validators key and 'validate_options' function.
v0.2.1 Cleaned up code to PEP8.
v0.2.2 Exception for plugint types not yet implemented.
v0.2.3 Fixed bucket-name issue if not at paths' root and non-standard ports for

v0.2.6 Tested with Minio
v0.2.7 Added files counted to S3 Generic.
v0.2.8 Changed S3 generic API from list_objects_v2 to list_objects as CephS3
       doesn't have the "NextContinuationToken" directive and thus would only
       list the first 1000. This needs to be updated one Ceph has this as
       v1 is sort of deprecated.
v0.2.9 Added ability to specify S3 signature version.
v0.2.10 Added options for memcached, stdoutput and some debugging.
v0.2.11 Fixed issue with ID names with multiple "."
v0.3.0 Added DAV/Http support.

       ceph-admin error.

v0.3.4 Fixed json parsing from requests using it's native json function to
       solve issue with json module of python 3.4.

       warnings.
v0.4.1 Added exceptions and error handling for S3 storagestats ceph-admin.
v0.4.2 Added exceptions and error handling for S3 storagestats, generic.
v0.4.3 Added exceptions for configuration file errors, missing options,
       unsupported plugins.
v0.4.4 Added exceptions and error handling for DAV storagestats.
v0.4.5 Changed error to use the exception names. Works better and cleaner.
v0.4.6 ssl_check now uses the ca_path if declared and ssl_check is true.
v0.4.7 Removed the warnings and instead added a status and debug attribute
       to StorageStats objects. Status appends the last ERROR. Debug appends
       all the ones that occur with more detail if available.
v0.4.8 Improved memcached and status/debug output.
v0.4.9 Added starttime and execbeat output.
v0.5.0 Added memcached exceptions, error messages. Added option for execbeat
       output.
v0.6.0 Added quota options and logic to S3 and DAV operations.
v0.6.1 Moved ouptut to object class method.
v0.6.2 Added debug output.
v0.6.3 Renamed storagestats attribute from options to plugin_options.
v0.7.0 Functions don't depend on cli options. Module can be used from the
       interpreter.
v0.7.1 XML StAR files output implemented for S3 and DAV.
v0.7.2 Added generic DAV method to list and obtain used space. Renamed required
       options from quota to storagetats.quota and s3.api to storagestats.api.
v0.7.3 Bug fixes when storagestats.api in DAV was not specified. Cleaned up
       unused parameters in exception classes. Added documentation to all
       exception classes. Cleaned code according to pep8 guidelines.
v0.7.4 Single XML StAR file output with all endpoints' stats.
v0.7.5 Conf files to be processed A->Z
v0.7.6 Fixes multiple whitelines in config files.
v0.7.7 Added logging to files, pwd and WARNING and above.
v0.8.0 Logging module now takes care of creating log messages for file and
       memcached status.
v0.8.1 Added option to specify ouptut logfile.
v0.8.2 Adding INFO and DEBUG file logs
v0.8.3 Added logger definitions to all functions. Added 200 status code check
       and handler for DAV endpoints.
v0.8.4 Global settings mechanism and renamed options to settings, in all vars
       comments and docs.
v0.8.5 Added Azure support. Utilizes azure-storage module's list_blobs function.
       Added the necessary exceptions. Stdout shows filecount, when available.
v0.8.6 Removed schema arguments for debug reporting on S3 schema validation
       which are not used and caused the program to fail.
v0.8.7 Added filecount for S3 ceph-admin api.
v0.8.8 Adds option to specify output directory for storagestats files as
       dynafed_storagestats with its corresponding extension. Adds json file
       output.
v0.8.9 Adds plain txt file output.
v0.8.10 Fixed wrong schema error by having the plugin_settings being validated
        before the schema. Added exception for SchemaIssues. Fixed issue with
        exceptions by adding keywords to the "supr" calls. Added exception
        message to the debug so the --debug output contains the full information.
v0.8.11 Added 'Delimiter': '*' to S3 generic, necessary to iterate AWS buckets.
v0.8.12 Added timeouts to S3 and DAV methods of 5 seconds.
v0.9.0 Added multithreading so that endpoints don't have to wait for others to
        finish. Added function to check Dynafed's connection stats from memcache
        in order to flag endpoints that are offline and skip them from checks.
v0.9.1 Added verbose option to print on sterr logger events.
v0.9.2 Added flexibility to the "check" variable to allow bypassing for invalid
       settings in config files.
v0.9.3 Revamped the exception handling and loggers in order to remove the
       "mlogger" while keeping a consistent format on error reporting and removing
       the necessity to instantiate a second logger. This also facilitates
       flexibility for exception handling so these can be removed from levels
       where it does not belong (before it was used for logging as well and that
       was a bad design.) Removed error message from memcache's status field.
       the error codes should give sufficient information. If more is needed
       the user should either check the logfile or manually run with verbose.
v0.9.4 Updated where in the logic the endpoints' status attribute is given an
       "OK". Also now the memcached index holds multiple errors in a CSV format.
v0.9.5 Added an exception handling when for DAV's RFC4331 obtains zero free
       bytes. While this might be a legitimate empty endpoint, it could also
       be a system that is not configured properly or lacks the ability to
       report this information in which case a manual quota should be input.
